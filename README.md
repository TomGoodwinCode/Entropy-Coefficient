# Entropy-Coefficient

This is a repository for the operation of a experimental device to measure the entropy coefficent of lithium-ion batteries. 


FILE #1: EntropyCoefficient.py

This is the main file of the program. 



FILE #2: EntropuGUI.py

This is the GUI of the device.


FILE #3: A Time Efficient Technique to Determine The Entropy Coefficient Of A Lithium Ion Cell.pdf

This is the group report on the project.
